# Haircut Manager

Haircut Manager is a simple Python application with a Text User Interface (TUI) that allows you to track your haircuts. You can easily record essential information such as the date, location, and cost of each haircut session, and all the data is stored in a CSV file. The application also provides basic statistics based on the collected haircut data. This is a very short personal project, and I hope to finish it in the coming days.
